# GRC Leadership Lab â€” RiskHunter-labs

Welcome to **GRC Leadership Lab**, a simulation-based portfolio showcasing the design, execution, and continuous improvement of security, privacy, and risk (SPR) programs. Built by **Richard Dor** under the **RiskHunter-labs** identity, this lab demonstrates what high-impact GRC leadership looks like in modern, cloud-native, multi-framework environments.

---

## Purpose

This project simulates the real-world responsibilities of a CISO or GRC Program Director, including:
- Designing multi-framework compliance architectures
- Leading AI and privacy governance
- Operating secure-by-default programs
- Enabling sales and customer trust through compliance transparency
- Driving continuous maturity improvement with metrics, scenarios, and Board-level reporting

All artifacts are GitHub-native and defensible in audit, interview, or consulting scenarios.
