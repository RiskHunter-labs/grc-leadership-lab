# 🏗️ Athenex Solutions – Technical Reference Architecture

This reference architecture illustrates how Athenex delivers secure, compliant, AI-powered cloud services and SaaS platforms to regulated industries using a multi-cloud, hybrid infrastructure.

---

## 1. Core Design Principles

- Cloud-First, Hybrid-Enabled: SaaS and AI workloads run primarily in the cloud; sensitive workloads handled in colocation or customer-dedicated zones.  
- Zero Trust by Default: Identity and context drive all access decisions, across cloud and on-prem.  
- Compliance-by-Design: Architecture maps directly to ISO 27001, SOC 2, FedRAMP, HIPAA, GDPR, and NIS2/DORA.  
- Modular & Scalable: Services are containerized and orchestrated via Kubernetes (EKS, AKS, GKE).  
- AI-Ready: Purpose-built compute zones for training, fine-tuning, and serving LLMs/agents.  
- Global Trust: Architected to meet data sovereignty, regional compliance, and customer assurance requirements.
